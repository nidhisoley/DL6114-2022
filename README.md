# BMI6114- Spring(2022)
### The department of Biomedical Informatics
### The University of Utah

BMI6114 is a post-graduate course that is an applied introduction to deep learning, a branch of machine learning, aiming to understand and practice the development and application of modern neural networks. In that vein, the course will provide students with a working knowledge of deep learning fundamentals that presents a start point for using more advanced techniques in their future careers. The course will start with reviewing and implementing the main mathematics, statistics, and machine learning principles that will be required during the course. Then, the students will learn how deep learning algorithms extract layered high-level representations of data to optimize feature learning, cluster analysis, and classification machine learning tasks.  Hands-on activities will provide students with experience of implementing deep learning architectures for biomedicine applications.
